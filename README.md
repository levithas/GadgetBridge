Gadgetbridge
============

Gadgetbridge is an Android (5.0+) application which will allow you to use your
Pebble, Mi Band, Amazfit Bip and HPlus device (and more) without the vendor's closed source application
and without the need to create an account and transmit any of your data to the
vendor's servers.
